# @microboxlabs/miot-dashboard-ui

Pure dashboard layout utilities, using the document types and grid constants from
`@microboxlabs/miot-dashboard-contract`. The current package exports `./core` only;
it does not yet export a dashboard renderer or editor. This workspace version is
unreleased.

## Grid sizing

```ts
import { computeGridSizing } from "@microboxlabs/miot-dashboard-ui/core";

const sizing = computeGridSizing({ containerWidth: 1200, usedCols: 24 });
// { cols: 24, designWidth: 1600, scale: 0.75, offsetLeft: 0 }
```

`computeGridSizing({ containerWidth, usedCols }): GridSizing` computes the visual
grid dimensions without changing persisted widget coordinates. Width is measured
in pixels; `usedCols` is the greatest `x + w` of the widgets. For an unmeasured
container (width at or below zero), scale remains 1. The visual scale is capped
at the exported `MAX_SCALE` (1.35). Inputs must be finite numbers.

```ts
interface GridSizing {
  cols: number;
  designWidth: number;
  scale: number;
  offsetLeft: number;
}
```

## New widget position

`getNextPosition(siblings, width = 1): { x: number; y: number }` places a widget
after the occupied columns in the deepest occupied row, or below that row if it
does not fit. Siblings need only the shared `Widget.layout` shape. The function
does not mutate its input. Positions and sizes must be valid document grid units.

## Runtime and compatibility

The ESM `./core` entry is usable in browsers and Node.js without React, Next.js,
DOM globals or the dashboard server runtime. It depends on the shared contract
version `^0.5.0`; it does not define another document schema. Only documented
package exports are supported import paths.
